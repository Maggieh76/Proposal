# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Henry the Hangman

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a game where a random word is generated and automatic lines are put out. The player can submit a letter by clicking it on the keyboard and if it is correct it will appear in the word, if not it a body part of Henry will appear.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A random word will generate from a dictionary library. The player will input guesses by clicking letters on the keyboard. Their guess will be run through the word to see if it exists. If the letter exists in the word then it will be shown on the screen. However, if it isn't then a body part of Henry the Hangman will appear. I am going to do sound effects and have them change according to whether the letter is in the word or not (success or fail). I'm going to make it using lua and love.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to be able to have the simple game work where a word is generated and the player guesses letters and wins or loses.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

There is a stand there and when the player guesses wrong it adds limbs and as the person guesses right nothing happens. If the whole body appears they lose.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything previously stated and then that there are sound effects when the player gets it right or wrong and maybe even a timer for guessing time.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to practice/learn lua and love and learn how to properly make a game in those. I will need to research how to use a general word dictionary and implement that into my code. I will also have to research "in"  for loops in lua and see the similarities with python since that is how I will check if a word has a letter in it and figure out to do this with arrays and without 26 different functions.
